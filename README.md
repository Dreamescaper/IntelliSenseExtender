# Features:
- Suggest interfaces implementations or derived types during assignments
- Suggest static factory methods if they are present for type during assignments 
- Suggest suitable locals and members first

# :warning: Warning:
- Microsoft has added the ability to show items from unimported namespaces when autocompleting with Intellisense. Because of that this plugin does not provide unimported types completions. If using Visual Studio >16.8, enable "Show items from unimported namespaces" in the Visual Studio options window.
